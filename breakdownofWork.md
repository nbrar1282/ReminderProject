Navdeep Singh Brar:
I worked on the following tasks:

Editing a Task - Implemented functionality for users to update reminder details including title, description, and completion status.

Deleting a Task - Developed a feature to delete reminders, allowing users to remove tasks from their list effectively.

I watched the videos from week 10 to understand how these two functionalities work.
